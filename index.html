      <h2>About me!</h2>
      </iframe>
      <p>I’ve always thrived in roles that stretch my skills across entrepreneurship, business development, and client relationships. My journey began at New York University, where I studied political science and dived deep into Political Theory and International Law. Those courses really honed my analytical thinking, which came in handy when I started my own organic meal kit company. That was a rollercoaster! From drafting business plans to navigating cultural nuances while building a team—it was all about connecting the dots in real-time.Throughout my career, I've aimed for excellence and constantly sought new learning opportunities. Whether it was negotiating with government officials or promoting sustainability initiatives, I've always brought a strategic and results-focused approach to my work. Now, as I look to the future, I'm excited to bring all these experiences into new and challenging environments.
